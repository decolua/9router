# 9Router

Local/remote AI gateway exposing OpenAI-compatible REST. One key, many providers, auto-fallback.

## Setup

```bash
export NINEROUTER_URL="http://localhost:20128"      # or VPS / tunnel URL
export NINEROUTER_KEY="sk-..."                      # from Dashboard → Keys (only if requireApiKey=true)
```

All requests: `${NINEROUTER_URL}/v1/...` with header `Authorization: Bearer ${NINEROUTER_KEY}` (omit if auth disabled).

Verify: `curl $NINEROUTER_URL/api/health` → `{"ok":true}`

## Discover models

```bash
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models                  # chat/LLM (default)
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/image            # image-gen
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/tts              # text-to-speech
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/embedding        # embeddings
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/web              # web search + fetch (entries have `kind` field)
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/stt              # speech-to-text
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/image-to-text    # vision
```

Use `data[].id` as `model` field in requests. Combos appear with `owned_by:"combo"`.

Response shape:
```json
{ "object": "list", "data": [
  { "id": "openai/gpt-5", "object": "model", "owned_by": "openai", "created": 1735000000 },
  { "id": "tavily/search", "object": "model", "kind": "webSearch", "owned_by": "tavily", "created": 1735000000 }
]}
```
