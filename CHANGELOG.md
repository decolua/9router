# Unreleased

## Features
- **Router**: an orchestration nudge now states the live delegation count back to
  the model when a session runs past its cap. The delegation rule lives in the
  client's `CLAUDE.md`, but a rule read once at the start is buried under 174K of
  context by turn 40 and stops being acted on — one observed session made 83
  consecutive `cat`/`grep`/`find` calls with zero delegations, served by a
  legitimate Fenrir-band model that had received both the rule and the Agent tool
  intact. The rule was delivered; it was forgotten. The count does not need to be
  remembered, because the client sends the whole conversation on every turn, so
  the router recomputes it from the tool blocks already in the request body and
  injects the actual number at the moment it matters — reminding at the cap and
  escalating at double it, and also naming a previous delegation that specified no
  model and therefore silently inherited the session's expensive one. Counted on
  the source body, where tool blocks are still in the client's shape, and injected
  into the translated body via the existing format-aware `systemInject`, so it
  reaches every combo and every provider format without per-handler wiring.
  Deliberately stateless, unlike the discipline nudge: that one corrects a past
  event and must self-clear, while this reflects a condition that is still true
  and should keep firing until a delegation resets the count. Fail-open — any
  error leaves the body untouched. This nudges; it cannot compel. A model that
  ignores it is now measurable, which is the evidence for not making it a lead

## Fixes
- **Router**: a degenerate opening no longer reaches the client. The combo
  preflight, which already read the first chunk before committing to a model,
  now holds a short window open — bounded by a chunk budget, a 300ms wall clock
  that only runs when the stream actually pauses, and stopping the moment there
  is enough prose to judge — and fails over to the next combo member when the
  opening is a continuation rather than a reply: it begins on sentence
  punctuation, or resumes mid-sentence after a single stray space. Failing over
  is the right response where deleting text is
  not: a retry costs one upstream call, a wrong deletion costs the answer. The
  rules are structural and narrow, because a false positive here discards a
  working model: indentation never counts (a reply opening on a code line is
  not a continuation), and a prefill — a request whose last turn is the
  assistant's — is exempt outright, since resuming mid-sentence is exactly what
  a prefill asks for. Verbatim regurgitation is deliberately left to the
  existing `utils/userEcho.js`, where a mistake costs less than a discarded
  model. An error met while reading ahead is replayed, never cascaded, so the
  existing "no cascade once the first chunk arrived" rule still holds
- **Router**: responses now carry `x-9r-serving-model`, the provider/model that
  actually answered. A request names a combo alias and the router picks a
  member, so one conversation could be served by several models with nothing
  saying so — observed as three models on one thread while the client displayed
  one alias throughout
- **Translator**: `claude:gemini` is a direct route. The pair was crossing two
  rebuilds of its message list via the OpenAI pivot, which is where its turn
  structure was being lost; `CLAUDE.md` already prescribes a direct route for
  fragile pairs. Gemini also delivers a functionCall whole, so the direct path
  has no partial-argument accumulation and none of the doubling the
  openai-compat path defends against
- **Translator**: a Gemini-served model would stop replying and start completing
  the user's sentence — mid-word, in the user's voice — after enough turns. Two
  rules combined to cause it: an assistant turn whose parts came out empty was
  never pushed, and `normalizeGeminiContents` merged whatever ended up adjacent.
  Drop a model turn between two user turns and those user turns fuse. In an
  agentic session, where every tool result arrives as a `user` turn, the model's
  voice eroded a little each round until Gemini was handed a transcript in which
  it had never spoken — an unfinished monologue, which it continued. A six-round
  tool exchange lost half its model turns. Empty turns now keep their slot on
  all three affected paths (`openai-to-gemini`, the Antigravity envelope, and
  `openai-to-claude`, which dropped the turn one hop earlier), never as a
  trailing prefill. `findSpeakerBoundaryViolation` asserts the invariant so a
  future edit that reintroduces the erasure is loud rather than silent.
  The echo scrubbers made this worse over time: each scrub emptied an assistant
  turn, and the emptied turn was then dropped from the next request. The
  placeholder is non-whitespace because `hasValidContent` filters blank blocks
  straight back out, and is never left trailing, where an assistant turn is a
  prefill the model continues from
- **Tests**: `verify-no-regression.mjs` recovered the repo-relative path by
  splitting on `/app/`, so outside the container every entry became
  `undefined :: <name>`, matched nothing in the baseline, and reported all 98
  failures as regressions — the gate only ever worked in Docker. It anchors on
  the `tests/` segment now, and `known-fails.txt` is re-measured (87 entries,
  was 24), built from the union of a branch run and a clean-tree run so the two
  flaky xai files cannot masquerade as regressions
- **Tests**: the 13 `security-audit` assertions that read repo source resolved
  `src/...` against the process cwd, so running the suite the documented way
  (`cd tests && npx vitest run`) failed every one with ENOENT on `tests/src/...`.
  They anchor on the file's own location and pass from anywhere
- **Tuner**: bands are derived from a model's declared identity instead of guessed
  from its id. `matchBench` ended in a substring scan, which failed in both
  directions on the same model — `ag/gemini-3.1-pro-low` matched `gemini-3.1-pro`
  and inherited an `opus` band it never earned, while `ag/gemini-pro-agent`, the
  HIGH variant, matched no key at all and was invisible to every combo. A
  fable-band combo served the low variant for two full sessions while the high one
  sat unused. `gcli/grok-4.5-low` and `-medium` had the same defect
- **Tuner**: an unbanded candidate is still invisible to every combo, but no longer
  silently — every run names it, says whether its family is undeclared or merely
  unbanded, records it in the tuner state, and posts to the Discord webhook when
  the list changes
- **Tuner**: TTS, image and STT models are no longer banded as chat models. Eleven
  ids (`mimo-v2.5-tts*`, `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image`,
  `gpt-5.5-image`, …) were substring-matching a chat family and competing for
  combo slots
- **Tuner**: `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` and `gpt-5.5-pro` get their own `bench.json`
  entries instead of borrowing a neighbour's tier. Both stay at their former band —
  neither has a published benchmark, and an unproven model is banded low

## Features
- **Providers**: registry model entries declare `family`, `effort` and `mode`
  beside `upstreamModelId`. Bands attach to families; `effort` shifts a band by a
  declared offset from `bench._effortBandOffset`; `mode` (`thinking`, `agentic`,
  `review`, …) never moves one. Matching is exact — substring inference is gone, so
  a low-effort variant cannot reach its family's tier by any path
- **Endpoint**: `/v1/models` reports a model's declared `family` / `effort` / `mode`
  when it has them, so the tuner (a separate process) can band without re-deriving

## Docs
- **CONTEXT.md**: new glossary for the routing vocabulary — family, effort, mode,
  route, band, candidate, pool, combo, quota domain, frame integrity. Much of this
  previously lived only inside `bench.json` `_comment` strings
- **ADR**: `docs/adr/0001` records why model identity is `(family, effort, mode)`
  and why bands are never inferred from ids, with the four alternatives rejected

# v0.5.50 (2026-08-05)

## Features
- **Providers**: add TokenRouter (300+ models via OpenAI-compatible gateway) with
  exact per-model pricing for 110 models and `reasoning_effort` thinking config
- **Providers**: add Self-hosted STT / TTS / Embedding — point 9Router at your own
  OpenAI-compatible speech and embedding servers (whisper.cpp, faster-whisper,
  Kokoro-FastAPI, llama-server, vLLM, Infinity). Unlike the named cloud providers
  these read `baseUrl` per connection, so one provider can front several machines
- **Combos**: default-enable vision/audio capacity adapter (auto-routes to a
  vision/audio-capable model when the target lacks that capability, falling back
  to `oc/mimo-v2.5-free`), wired into chat handler routing
- **Endpoint**: auto-provision a "Default Key" for first-time users so `/v1`
  works without a manual dashboard step
- **Codex**: support GPT-5.6 Max/Ultra reasoning-level overrides (cx/ routes only)
- **Qoder**: support PAT (Personal Access Token) connections end-to-end, alongside
  OAuth device flow
- **CLI tools**: add OpenDesign (manalkaff/opendesign) support
- **Headroom**: report effective payload savings (tool schema/history bytes broken
  out, byte-savings % reflects actual outbound reduction)
- **Ollama**: Cloud quota tracker (session + weekly) + proactive background OAuth
  token refresh scheduler for all providers

## Fixes
- **Providers**: remove Qwen (OAuth flow stopped working reliably)
- **Passthrough**: detect codex-tui/Codex Desktop as native Codex client — they
  were falling through to the translator and losing fields like `reasoning.summary`
- **OAuth**: scope antigravity header fixes to loadCodeAssist/onboardUser only
- **OAuth**: keep `open` external in the build so xAI/Grok token refresh works on
  Windows
- **OAuth**: declare missing `searchParams` in register-session handler (was a
  500 instead of JSON on error)
- **DB**: `ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGS` env var now overrides the UI setting correctly;
  observability defaults to off (opt-in)
- **Translator**: preserve Codex Responses Lite tool use across chat-native
  OpenAI-compatible providers
- **Translator**: don't drop image-only user messages in `prepareClaudeRequest`
- **Translator**: drop JSON Schema keywords Gemini rejects (`uniqueItems`,
  `contains`, `multipleOf`, `unevaluatedProperties`, `unevaluatedItems`,
  `contentSchema`)
- **Claude**: remove global header cache that leaked one client's identity
  headers onto another client/account sharing the server; gate `anthropic-beta`
  by model instead
- **Antigravity**: drop retired Gemini 3.0 quota tiers, show Gemini 3.6 Flash
  usage bars
- **Cloudflare AI**: declare API key authentication (dashboard showed "No
  connections" despite an active key)
- **GitHub Copilot**: hold monthly-exhausted accounts until UTC month reset
  instead of only cooling down 120s
- **CodeBuddy**: dodge Tencent CN content filter, add usage tracking, normalize
  codebuddy-intl messages
- **Usage**: stop losing cached prompt tokens in the forced-SSE→JSON path
- **Grok CLI**: display the public subscription tier from the OAuth token claim
- **Providers**: count apikey connections for Ollama free-tier card; free-tier/
  apikey providers without `authModes` now default to apikey (were treated
  oauth-only)
- **Build**: include static/public assets in standalone output (login page hung
  on 404s when run via PM2)
- **Server**: support IntelliJ IDEA OpenAI-compatible clients over HTTP (h2c
  upgrade handling)
- **Auth**: redirect already-logged-in sessions away from `/login`
- **CLI tools**: enable Apply button for dynamic OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible
  provider connections
- **CLI**: include complete API artifacts in the CLI package
- **TTS**: a bare self-hosted model name is the MODEL, not the voice — `kokoro`
  was parsed as a voice against a default model, 404ing or synthesising with the
  wrong one
- **Embeddings**: self-hosted embeddings no longer fall back to `api.openai.com`
  when a connection has no `baseUrl` — that silently sent the input text and API
  key to OpenAI under a provider named "Self-hosted"
- **Embeddings**: an adapter that rejects a misconfigured connection now returns
  400 with the reason instead of escaping the handler uncaught
- **Embeddings**: bound the upstream fetch with `FETCH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` — an
  endpoint that drops packets never returns headers, so the request previously
  hung indefinitely

# v0.5.2 (2026-06-17)

## Features
- **Combo Fusion strategy** — fans the prompt out to all member models in parallel, then a configurable judge model synthesizes one final answer (quorum-grace, anonymized sources, graceful degradation)
- **Per-combo strategy selector** — pick `fallback` / `round-robin` / `fusion` / `capacity` per combo (replaces the old round-robin toggle), with a judge picker for fusion
- **Capacity auto-switch** — reorders models per request so images/PDFs route to capable models first
- **Kiro headless API-key auth** (`ksk_`) + direct `claude↔kiro` route that avoids the lossy OpenAI two-hop pivot
- **Claude auto-ping** — warms the 5h quota window right after reset so a fresh window starts immediately (per-connection toggle)

## Fixes
- **Claude 429**: stop hammering the OAuth usage endpoint — cache resetAt, throttle quota refresh to 3 min, cool down after a 429 (chat unaffected)
- **Usage logs always empty**: missing `await` on `getAdapter()` in `getRecentLogs` made `/api/usage/logs` & `/api/usage/request-logs` return nothing
- **Executors**: strip params unsupported by the provider/model (drops deprecated `temperature` for claude-opus-4 → Anthropic 400)
- **Translator**: derive deterministic tool_call ids for gemini/antigravity → OpenAI so function call/response pair correctly (fixes tool-pairing 400s)
- **Antigravity**: strip `optional` from tool schemas before sending to Gemini
- **Claude-to-OpenAI**: handle OpenAI-format responses in the non-streaming path (e.g. xiaomi-tokenplan)
- **Usage views**: show edited connection names consistently across Providers & Quota Tracker
- **Security**: hardened reverse-proxy local-access trust
- **Security**: SSRF hardening on web fetch

## Internal
- Large **open-sse / translator refactor** (~40 commits): unified provider/model registry (LiteLLM-style `models[]` + `kind` field, 100 co-located registry files), single-sourced media/OAuth/refresh/token URLs, registry-based dispatch for usage & token-refresh, DRY translator concerns (buildUsage, encodeDataUri, finishReasonMap, chunkBuilder, reasoningDelta…), ESM-safe registry init, large-file splits, dead-code removal, and golden/no-regression test gates
